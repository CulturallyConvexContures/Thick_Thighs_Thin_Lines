# 💋 Welcome to the Cheeksheets Dojo

This is not your average cheat sheet folder — this is a vault of scrolls forged in flavor, precision, and sass.  
Each one holds sacred knowledge, annotated with cheek and served dojo-hot.

## 📜 The Scroll Collection

### 🦴 [bootedup-markedup.md](./🦴bootedup-markedup.md)
The HTML scroll. Tags, structure, bones — booted up and ready for markup glory.

### 💁‍♀️ [thigh-gap-and-padding.md](./💁‍♀️-thigh-gap-and-padding.md)
The CSS spacing bible. Where margins stretch and padding supports — with legroom.

### 🍑 [if-thicc-then-wobble.md](./🍑if-thicc-then-wobble.md)
Python logic with bounce. Conditionals, loops, and curve-compatible control flow.

### 👙 [scaling-with-style.md](./👙-scaling-with-style.md)
A thicc overview of CSS units — rem, em, vw, and more. Responsive fits only.
